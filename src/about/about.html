        Our low-cost, 3D-printed prosthetic hand named "Cyborg Beast" was designed using modeling software called Blender and manufactured
        in the researcher's laboratory using desktop 3D printers. Elastic cords placed inside the dorsal aspect of the fingers
        provide passive finger extension. Finger flexion is driven by non-elastic cords along the palmar surface of each
        finger and is activated through 20-30 degrees of wrist flexion.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
        The result is a composite fist (flexing the fingers towards the palm) for gross grasp. The materials used for printing our
        prosthetic hand are polylactide (PLA) plastic and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Other components of the
        prosthetic hand include Chicago screws of various sizes, 1 mm lift nylon cord, 1.5 mm elastic cord, Velcro, medical-grade
        firm padded foam, protective skin sock, and a dial tensioner system. The majority of these materials are available
        at local hardware stores or online. The present cost of materials is about $50 USD, The average time to fully assemble
        the prosthetic hand design is approximately 2. 5 hours. The weight of a fully assembled hand at a 140% of its original
        size is 184.2 grams.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
        A similar device costs approximately $4,000 and weighs about 400 grams. The Cyborg Beast prosthetic hand is well suited for
        activities that involved the manipulation of light objects using lateral, power (composite), and spherical prehensile
        patterns.
