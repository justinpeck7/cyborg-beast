        The proximal finger sections are closer to the palm with the distal section being the finger tips. Notice that the 2 pieces for the thumb are slightly different in that the distal finger is smaller than the rest and the proximal finger is wider.

        All sections that are to be secured with a Chicago screw must be drilled with a 7/32” bit. If you are assembling a small hand, you may need to start with a smaller bit and work up to a 7/32” bit in order to avoid splintering the plastic.

        All smaller holes that support both the elastic cord and the tension cord must be drilled to clean out excess debris. The finger sections must be drilled on both the top (for the elastic cord) and the bottom (for the tension cord). A 1/16th drill bit is sufficient for the opening on the bottom section. However, depending on the size of the hand to be assembled, a slightly larger drill bit may be used for the top holes.

        Using a small file, smooth all rough edges of the plastic pieces. A nail file or emery board may be used in place of a small file. Depending on the quality of the printing and the size of the hand, there may be minimal filing or more involved filing to be done.

        Once all the rough edges are smooth, assemble the proximal and distal finger sections with a Chicago screw. The finger should move freely through the full range without limitations. If the range is limited or there is friction with movement, remove the screw and file the rounded end of the proximal finger piece until there is full and free movement at the joint. Additional filing of the sides may also be necessary.

        Choose elastic cord that is best suited for the size of the Cyborg Beast hand that is being assembled. For a larger hand, 2mm elastic cord is appropriate. For a smaller hand 1.5 mm elastic cord will be sufficient.
    </p>
    <p class="asm-text">
        Cut 5 pieces of elastic cord approximately 7 inches long. At one end of the cord secure a knot. If using thinner cord, 2 knots may be required to keep the elastic from slipping back through the finger.

        Begin by threading the cord through the top of the distal  finger piece. Proceed to thread the elastic cord through the proximal finger piece as shown. The end of the cord is then threaded down through the palm section.
    </p>
    <p class="asm-text">
        Tip: If it is difficult to push the cord through the holes, a thin piece of wire or nylon thread can be used to assist with pulling the cord through. Fold a thin wire or nylon thread in half and push it through the hole. Loop the wire around the cord end and pull back through the hole. A pair of tweezers or needle nose pliers can be helpful in manipulating the cords.

        The thumb elastic cord is pulled through and secured as pictured below. Before tying the knot, pull on the cord to make sure the knot will is secure and will not pull through the end of the finger. Then adjust the tension in the cord so that it is adequate to just maintain the finger in the straightened position. Too much tension will require extra force by the prosthesis user to achieve finger flexion.

        With the fingers, adjust the tension in much the same manner, assuring that tension is adequate but not too much. Secure the 2 cords on the palmer surface with a square knot.  If tension adjustments are required later, the knots can be untied and adjusted as necessary.

        After threading cords through the tension bar, secure with knots, making sure the tension is consistent in all cords.
        If tension is consistent, all fingers should pull down together. Adjust tension on knots as necessary. Once the tension is accurate in both the elastic cords and tension cords, all cord ends can be trimmed. A drop of super glue is recommended on all knots to make sure they stay secured.
        An additional strap can be secured in the palm section with 2 Chicago screws.
