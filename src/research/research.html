        Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a process of making a 3D solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing technology is used for both prototyping and distributed manufacturing with applications in several areas, such as construction, engineering, dental, and prosthetics among others.

        The current cost for a myoelectric prosthetic hand range from $10,000 to $50,000, while the cost for a body-powered prosthetic hand ranges from $4,000 dollars to $20,000. Due to the complexity and high cost of these prosthetics devices they are not accessible for children of low income or uninsured families. Furthermore, most of the current prosthetics do not adapt to the normal growth of the children limbs which limit their use and replacement. The cheapest option available is a passive prosthetic hook with a cost that range from $ 500 to $1,000 USD. There is an increasing need for a practical, easy to replace, customized, low-cost, prosthetic hand device for children. Thus, The purpose of the present investigation was to examine improvement in perceived changes in quality of life, daily usage, and activities performed with our low-cost prosthetic hand named Cyborg Beast.

        <strong class="underline">Subjects:</strong> Nine children (two girls and seven boys, 3 to 16 years of age) with upper-limb reductions (one traumatic and eight congenital) were fitted with our 3D printed prosthetic hand and were asked to complete a survey.

    <p class="research-text">
        <strong class="underline">Results:</strong> After approximately 1 to 3 months of using our prosthetic hand 11 children and
        their parents reported some increases in quality of life (4 indicated that was significant
        and 7 indicated a small increase), while 1 indicated no change. Nine children reported
        using the hand 1 to 2 hours a day, 3 reported using the prosthetic hand longer than 2
        hours and 1 reported using the hand only when needed. Furthermore, children reported
        using our prosthetic hand for activities at home (9), just for fun (10), to play (6), for
        school activities (4), and to perform sports (2).

        The purpose of this project was to design an inexpensive 3D printed shoulder
        prosthesis to perform bi-manual and unilateral activities with a functional grasp.  The
        mechanical device utilized in the study is able to achieve gross grasp by protracting the
        non-affected shoulder. Additionally the prosthesis allows for manual adjustment options
        for wrist pronation and supination, elbow and shoulder flexion and extension, as well as
        shoulder internal and external rotations.
